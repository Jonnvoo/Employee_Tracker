# Employee_Tracker

## Description 
This app uses MySQL to create tables that have foreign keys to connect the tables to each other. Once the MySQL documents have been SOURCE then you would have created a database that contains information for each table. When the database is created then you are ready to run the app. In this app you have multiple options you can choose from. The options are to view departments, employees, or roles. The other options are to change the data in the tables. You can add departments, roles, and employees, as well as update the current employees. This is all ran using node js to call the javascript file.

## Installation 
* npm init -y 
* npm i
* npm install mysql2
* npm install inquirer
* npm install console.table --save

## Usage 
Installing mysql2 is needed to grab the information from MySQL to bring over to your js files. Inquirer is used to getting the command prompts in your console log. "Console.table" is just used for styling your data tables for a cleaner look. These are all the packages that are needed to run this app. You would also need to SOURCE  the SQL documents to create the data table and generate the preset data for the tables. Once you have done all that just run "node index.js" there will have all the options from inquirer.
